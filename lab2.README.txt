Description:

Uses a matrix of vec3 coordinates to create a 2D ~diamond plane on z=5.
Accepts input from the keyboard keys WASD and 1 by use of keycodes.
    Modifies the x or y variable which is a uniform (global) variable which adds/subtracts 
        from gl_position in the html file.
    This has an if/else filter on it to stop the .12 pixel shape from passing the boundaries 
        of the 2x2 pixel viewing area.
